Early stopping VI
==============================


## Code
All codes we used are in the `codes` folder
The models we implemented are located in the `core` folder.  
Please note that `networks.py` and `utils.py` are directly sourced from [LazyVI](https://github.com/Willett-Group/lazyvi).  
We used this code when comparing our method to LazyVI in a high-dimensional regression setting.  
A complete example can be found in `LazyVI Demo.ipynb`.  
To replicate the experiments presented in the paper, refer to the code in the `exps` folder.
